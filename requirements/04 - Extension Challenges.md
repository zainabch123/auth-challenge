# Extension Challenges

These are optional challenges that can be undertaken if you complete the exercise. You can choose to do one or all of them.

- The movies list is the same for all users - modify the schema and your server code so that each user has their own list of movies.
- Implement routing and move each form into its own page.
- Add error handling to the API routes and display appropriate error messages on the frontend.
- Checkout the `freedom` branch and build the app yourself.
