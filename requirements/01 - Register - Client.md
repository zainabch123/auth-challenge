# Register a user - Frontend

Work inside the `handleRegister` function in [src/client/App.jsx](../src/client/App.jsx).

The `username` and `password` parameters of the function are already hooked up to the form so you can focus on the function logic.

1. Send a request to the `/user/register` route to create a new user.
